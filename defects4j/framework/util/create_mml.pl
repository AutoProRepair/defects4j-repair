=head1 NAME

create_mml.pl -- Create mml files for all program revisions with reproducible bugs.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

create_mml.pl -p project_id -c class_dir -o out_dir [-v version_id]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Generates a mml file for every list of project-related classes in
C<class_dir> -- a list of classes has to be provided in a file with the
following naming convention:
B<"version_id".src>. 
The generated mml files are named "version_id".mml and written to C<out_dir>.

If the C<version_id> is provided in addition to the C<project_id>, then only 
this C<version_id> is considered for the project.
