--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Getting started:

1. Add Defects4J's executables to your PATH:
export PATH=$PATH:"path2defects4j"/framework/bin

2. Check installation and get information for a specific project (commons lang):
defects4j info -p Lang

3. Get information for a specific bug (commons lang, bug 1):
defects4j info -p Lang -v 1

4. Checkout a buggy source code version (commons lang, bug 1, buggy version):
defects4j checkout -p Lang -v 1b -w /tmp/lang_1_buggy

5. Change to the working directory, compile sources and tests, and run tests:
cd /tmp/lang_1_buggy
defects4j compile
defects4j test

Documentation:

Detailed documentation for any script or module can be viewed with:
perldoc <file>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Database abstraction:


Use ./bin/defects4j to 

  - view configuration of a specific project

  - view summary of a specific bug

  - checkout and compile faulty or fixed project versions
  
  - run test suite on faulty or fixed project versions
  
  - perform mutation analysis on fixed project versions

Run ./bin/defects4j to see a list of available commands.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Test execution framework:

The test execution framework provides the following scripts:
  
  - ./bin/run_bug_detection.pl: 
    Determines real fault detection rates of generated test suites and stores 
    the results in a csv-based database. Note that this script uses Perl DBI.
  
  - ./bin/run_mutation.pl: 
    Determines mutation scores of generated test suites and stores the results
    in a csv-based database. Note that this script uses Perl DBI.
  
  - ./bin/run_coverage.pl: 
    Determines code coverage ratios of generated test suites and stores the results
    in a csv-based database. Note that this script uses Perl DBI.
  
  - ./bin/run_evosuite.pl: Generates test suites using EvoSuite.
  
  - ./bin/run_randoop.pl: Generates test suites using Randoop.
