=head1 NAME

Vcs.pm -- Provides a simple abstraction for version control systems

=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head2 Example using Vcs::Svn:

use Vcs::Svn;

my $vcs = Vcs::Svn->new("project", "repo_url", "commit_db_file", \&_co_hook);

$vcs->checkout_id("1b", "/tmp/1b");

sub _co_hook {
    my ($vcs, $revision, $work_dir) = @_;

    # do some post processing
}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module provides a simple abstraction for version control systems.

=pod

A vcs object has to be instantiated with:

- Project name

- Repository url 

- File name of the commit database (commit-db), see below for details

- Reference to post-checkout hook (optional) -- if provided, this method is called after each checkout.

The commit database has to be a csv file with the structure C<version_id,rev_1,rev_2>.

=over 4

=item B<lookup> C<lookup(version_id)>

Queries the commit database (commit-db) and returns the C<revision_id> for 
the given C<version_id>. The format of the C<version_id> is B<\d+[bf]>.

=cut

    my ($self, $version_id) = @_;

    return $self->{_cache}->{$1}->{$2};

=pod

=item B<num_revision_pairs> C<num_revision_pairs()>

Returns the number of revision pairs in the C<commit-db>.

=cut
sub num_revision_pairs {
    my $self = shift;
    return scalar keys %{$self->{_cache}};

=pod

=item B<get_version_ids> C<get_version_ids()>

Returns an array of all C<version_id>s in the C<commit-db>.

=cut

=pod

=item B<checkout_id> C<checkout_id(version_id, work_dir)>

Performs a lookup of C<version_id> in the C<commit-db> followed by a checkout of 
the corresponding revision with C<revision_id> to C<work_dir>.
The format of the C<version_id> is B<\d+[bf]>.

deleted before the checkout if it already exists>.

Returns the diff between C<revision_id_1> and C<revision_id_2> or C<undef> if
the diff failed. The C<path> argument is optional and can be used to compute a diff 
between certain files or directories. Note that C<path> is relative to the root

Exports the diff between C<revision_id_1> and C<revision_id_2> to C<out_file>. 
The path argument is optional and can be used to compute a diff between certain 
files or directories. Note that C<path> is relative to the root of the working directory.

Applies the patch provided in C<patch_file> to the working directory
C<work_dir>.  The path argument is optional and used as prefix for the files
to be patched. Note that C<path> is relative to the root of the working directory.

=head2 Provide new Vcs implementation

The provided default implementations may be overriden to provide specific behavior.
In most cases it is sufficient to override the following abstract methods to provide a vcs-specific cmd:

=over 4

=item B<_checkout_cmd(revision, work_dir)>

      Returns the cmd to checkout C<revision> to the working directory C<work_dir>

=cut
sub _checkout_cmd { die $ABSTRACT_METHOD; }
=pod

=item B<_apply_cmd(work_dir, patch_file [, path])>

      Returns the cmd to apply the patch in file C<patch_file> to the working 
      directory C<work_dir>. The optional path C<path> is relative to the
      working directory and used to apply patches to certain files or directories.

=cut
sub _apply_cmd { die $ABSTRACT_METHOD; }
=pod

=item B<_diff_cmd(rev1, rev2, path)>

      Returns the cmd to compute a diff between two revisions C<rev1> and C<rev2>.
      The optional path C<path> is relative to the repository root and used to 
      diff between certain files or directories.
